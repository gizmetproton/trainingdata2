Well you have to be in London - the best way to do it is get 6 months experience temping - Claibon and Abbatt properties are always looking for temps and then you can find a permanent role once you know what sort of gig is best for you.
Most do 4 days on 4 days off and salary can go up to £32k pa.
Stay away from too high end - the seriously rich are sociopaths, stay away from the low end - so are the underclass.
Good luck - can highly recommend.

No offence but 32k does not sound comfy for London. Do you get discounted accommodation or something?

lmao, I'm sorry to break it to you but most of us in London are earning under 25 - 30k
We either live in shared-housing or with our parents. Usually split 4 or 5 ways.
The people you see earning over 30k are the minority.

Yup, considering the median UK salary is 27k, even less if you factor out the top 10% of earners.

It’s the mean that gets massively skewed by the top end, taking the top 10% out and calculating the median just changes it to the 45th percentile.

May sound like a really, really dumb question but how does one get into something like this? Like do you need a massive artistic imagination and such and go college/uni etc? A friend recommended I try something like this to get into working from home (I’m also a carer outside of work) but never had a decent answer

I really disagree. I’m not informed on the industry but I feel AI would only give a finished design that matches whatever input commands are given, and is only as good as the specific AI model is programmed to be visually. It won’t have the level of step by step customisation a real human graphic designer brings and wouldn’t have the drafts and initial designs and notes on how the design progressed to meet the specifications.
When you look at the theory & marketing psychology & thought process that goes into high level graphic design as well as the number of things that require graphic design sticking to a consistent aesthetic across a brand … it’s not something AI offers a 1-to-1 replacement for.

I went to to college for graphic design and advertisment but majority of the stuff I learnt by watching YouTube tutorials. The qualification at the end helps but it all comes down to a nice portfolio that will land you a job. Once you have a portfolio highlighting your skills, you can start looking for freelance jobs if you feel confident enough or look for junior graphic design roles.

You don't need a degree to pursue a career in programming. You can train yourself from home and then build a portfolio by undertaking voluntary or commissioned projects and you can then apply for jobs (Your demonstrated skills give you as much of a foot in the door as a formal qualification).
Another option is enrolling into a bootcamp. Bootcamps are typically designed to prepare you for employment within a relatively short period of time and often provide ongoing support to help you secure a job.
The government offers free programming bootcamps, primarily in web development, which can be a great option for those looking to start a career in this field.
You can find more information here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-a-skills-bootcamp

Depends on your goal. You can get jobs without a degree or even the need to do a bootcamp. But you are likely to find resistance in some companies who expect 2:1 at a good uni studying Maths, Physics , Computer science or similar degrees. Basically bigger companies want more academic credentials, best paid job in the industry does because it is their way to filtering out CVs. If you are happy with an average developer job, you should be able to get one by learning coding in your own time.

I’ve been various types of support worker for ten years, currently a drug and alcohol worker. This pretty much involves talking to clients all day every day. The ratio of introverts to extroverts in the office is about 10:1. By all accounts it doesn’t make sense. But it seems to be a field that attracts introverts.

Unsolved mystery, there’s a lot of crossover between substance misuse and mental health, most of my clients have experienced trauma, or have anxiety or depression, or various other things. So they’re usually not big “people people” either. I guess that makes them easy to relate to for introverts.

In my experience, introverts make amazing carers and counselling staff, because they're brilliant listeners. An extrovert gets energy from chatting and interacting. The last thing you need from a counsellor is them to talk at inappropriate junctures. An introvert understands the places and moments where silence is important.
They're also good fixers, because they want you to go away, and not come back. And the best way to achieve this is to sort out your problems.
One of the first proponents of modern psychiatry, William Henry Rivers, was undoubtedly a very introverted man. In one book, a patient describes him as being "a strip of emotive wallpaper", because what matters most is that the patient is actively listened too.

Researcher/data analyst - it is a good mix of time for independent working and collaborating. I get to have a nice team and work with people on projects without being in meetings all day. And I wfh 4 days with 1 office day which is perfect for me. I’m an introvert but I’m also social and wouldn’t be able to cope with a job where I didn’t ever interact with colleagues.

I was going to write this exact post! My one office day is Wednesday. Most collaboration is via Teams messages, though we do have the odd meeting for larger projects. I'm lucky enough to work with nice people who appreciate everyone has different social needs, so the one day I'm in is pretty chill.

There's only 2-3 people in my office at a time, it's easily 600 sq feet (big old Georgian building), and we only have to come in 2 days a week. I'm not especially introverted but certainly don't want to be around people all the time, so this works nicely.

Train driver - amazing job for so many reasons (despite the shift work) but one of the great things for me is it's solo work. You'll say hello to a few colleagues throughout the day, chat with your conductor if you know them and maybe answer the odd question from a passenger when you're on a platform. But that's about it. Most of the time you're in the cab on your own.
Sometimes you'll have to talk to signallers but the good thing from an introverts pov is that it's all structured. Your not making conversation, you just follow protocol.

I'm basically an actor, I spend all day pretending to be outgoing and sociable and then just switch off evenings and weekends. If anything, it's reenforced my preference to be at home and spend time on my own or with close family.

Engineering design. Work from home for years. Generally work in teams via Teams and it works better than being in the office.
Went to office for a week or two and the meeting rooms were crap, lots of technology issues, and people in office seemed to catch flu one after other.
Everything better on Teams; people can work from their desk or home, and if they're sidelined in a meeting, they can do other work or personal stuff until they're needed.

Introvert who has worked in customer service for many many years. My main successes in this have been down to my introversion. I don't want to talk to customers, and I definitely don't want them to come back again and bother me a second time. My complaints handling is good, because my aim is to fix the problem and get rid of you as quickly as possible. I have no interest in chatting.
Currently writing as a caretaker in a big church, and I love every minute of it. Just enough customer service to keep me grounded, but loads of alone time.

I'm a field service engineer in the medical field. I visit different hospitals daily and repair laboratory testing equipment. I work alone most days, and other than interacting with the customer 1st thing, and then after the job is done, I don't really speak to many people.
The problems I encounter during a visit can vary wildly so the job doesn't get boring, and it mostly keeps my brain ticking over nicely.
I take a book with me so at lunchtime I can relax, it's great.

work in finance, working from home since pandemic. maybe 1 work related call a day, non client facing. very chill, but deadlines can mean a bit of stress.
